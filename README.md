# dmwp
My first real life project using Django Framework.  
This project is made with the help of Django Framework for backend support. Also I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and bootstrap 5 for front-end development.      

This site is useful for any seller who wants to promote their product. The system will help them to perform CRUD operation on Product, Gallery image, their company information etc. Also I have created a coustomer form using which visitor can submit their queries which admin can seen and perform necessary actions.
